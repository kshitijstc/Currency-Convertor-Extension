# Currency Convertor Chrome Extension
### Overview
Welcome to the Currency Converter Chrome Extension! This extension seamlessly converts prices displayed on websites into your native currency, supporting a comprehensive list of 161 currencies. <br>
### Why I Developed This Extension
As a developer, I frequently encountered prices in USD for various tools and services needed during the development process. Manually converting these prices to my native currency was tedious, so I created this extension to automate the process and save time.
